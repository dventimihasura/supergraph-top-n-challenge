* What

This is a submission for [[https://github.com/hasura/supergraph-top-n-challenge][The SuperGraph Top-N Challenge]].

* Why

I wanted to see how well a no-code submission would perform.

* How

This uses an instance of PostgreSQL with its ~postgres_fdw~ Foreign
Data Wrapper in order to join data to the two databases under test.
It creates views over the foreign tables.  It uses PostGraphile to
expose those views as a GraphQL API.  And, it uses graphql-mesh to
transform the GraphQL API into the form needed by the test harness.

* Steps

```bash
docker compose up
```
